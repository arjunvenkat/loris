          <p>I founded Loris because I haven't seen online programming education done right. Students need more structure and support than what current online programs provide.</p>
          <p>I've taught beginner-focused programming classes to a range of students: middle- and high-schoolers, Chicago Public School teachers, working adults looking for a career change and MBA students from Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management and the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. All my students were most engaged when they were working on projects they desgined themselves.</p>

          <p>Building your own projects is hard work that requires support. High-quality in-person classes are often too expensive or not available nearby, especially for younger students. But existing online programs don't provide the support and social interaction that most of us need to really learn. Loris gives complete beginners an affordable but personalized learning environment so they can experience the thrill of turning their ideas into reality.</p>
