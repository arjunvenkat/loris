      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>Our hybrid program combines the human connection of in-person classes with the efficiency of online courses. You'll go through a personalized playlist of tutorials and exercies to get exposure to new material on your own, but you'll also attend regular video coaching labs with small groups of students working on similar problems.</p>
      <p>These hour-long labs are key to the learning process at Loris. While the tutorials and exercises give you an introduction to new material, their main job is to get you to think of good questions to ask during labs. Our trained coaches will help you through any issues you're having and guide your work on personal projects. You'll also get plenty of attention - all of your labs will have a 5:1 student-teacher ratio.</p>
      <p>In addition to the coaching you'll get from labs, we'll also give you feedback as you progress through the milestones in each course. Not everyone learns in the same way at the same rate, so you'll have the flexibility to learn at your own pace. We'll provide gentle reminders as well as plenty of support to make sure you're on track to achieving your goals.</p>
      <p>By the end of each course, you'll have a unique project that demonstrates your ability as well as a portfolio of all the learning that happened along the way!</p>
